# Adopt Dog Ltda (Project Under Construction)

# Do you want to know what is the Adopt Dog?
Adopt Dog is a non-profit shelter dedicated to rescuing street dogs, providing them with care, and facilitating their adoption to loving homes.

Unfortunately, they are facing challenges in managing the influx of animals, coordinating staff, and connecting with potential adopters. Consequently, they have decided to seek assistance from a developer or group of developers to create a tailored Salesforce solution for their needs.
